\# Linux Filesystem Structure



This document describes how the Linux filesystem is organized and how it behaves in real usage.



\## Root Directory (/)



The filesystem starts at `/`.



Everything exists under root. There are no drive letters like in Windows.



Breaking `/` breaks the system.



\## /bin and /sbin

\## /etc

\## /tmp

\## /usr

\## /var and /var/log

\## /dev

\## /proc

\## /srv
